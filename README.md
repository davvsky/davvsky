### Hello_world 👋

I’ve always been passionate about technology. I started out studying IT, but life had other plans and I had to take a break. During that time, I tried self-learning here and there — though I never quite made it to the finish line.  

Now, I’m finally back on track and fully committed to growing as a developer. My goal is to become a full-stack developer, and this GitHub is where I’ll share my progress, projects, and learning journey. 🚀
